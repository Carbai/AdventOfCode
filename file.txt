#Most accurate value to be corrected:
CCSD(T)/jun-cc-pVTZ = 
#Energy values at HF level for the calculation of HF energy at CBS limit:
HF/jun-cc-pVTZ = 
HF/jun-cc-pVQZ = 
HF/jun-cc-pV5Z = 
#Energy values at MP2 level for the calculation of MP2 energy at CBS limit, note that when corr only correlation energy is needed:
MP2/jun-cc-pVTZ = 
MP2corr/jun-cc-pVTZ = 
MP2corr/jun-cc-pVQZ = 
#Energy values at MP2 level for the core-valence correlation estimate
MP2/ae =
